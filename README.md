# 🃏 BlackJack OOP

## 🎮 About the Game
BlackJack OOP is a **console-based blackjack simulation** written in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. 
The game allows players to place bets, receive cards, and compete against the dealer with classic blackjack rules.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully functional **blackjack gameplay** with betting mechanics.
- Uses **OOP principles** (`Game`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Money`) for clean and modular code.
- Dynamic **betting system** with options for `Hit`, `Stand`, and `Double Down`.
- Simple **ASCII card display** for an engaging experience.
- Dealer logic follows official blackjack rules.

## ⚙️ How to Play
1. Run the script in a **Python-supported terminal**.
2. Enter your **bet** at the start of each round.
3. Receive your **initial hand** and decide your move:
   - `(H)it` → Draw a new card.
   - `(S)tand` → Keep your hand.
   - `(D)ouble down` → Double your bet & draw one more card.
4. The dealer plays after the player completes their move.
5. Win, lose, or draw based on **blackjack rules**!
